🔧 🧰 📦 🧭 🗂️

CMDBOX is a small, fast tool to collect, organize, and run script commands. It acts like a personal library for your command snippets. The goal is simple: save commands once, find them quickly, and run them reliably. It fits developers, admins, and IT pros who repeat the same shell interactions often. The design favors clarity and speed. You keep your snippets in a local, portable store. You execute them with a single command. You stay in control of how commands execute, how they’re named, and how they’re organized.

What you’ll find here
- A minimal CLI that hides the plumbing and makes commands easy to reuse.
- A structured snippet store with names, tags, and descriptions.
- Quick search and filtering to locate the exact snippet you want.
- A flexible runner that executes commands in your shell and returns clean results.
- Cross-platform support with native installers. Linux, Windows, and macOS builds are available in the Releases page.

If you need a compact tool to manage your script snippets, CMDBOX offers a calm, predictable workflow. It’s not flashy. It is dependable. And it scales with your needs.

About CMDBOX
CMDBOX is built around a single idea: help you keep a personal library of commands that you can reuse across projects. Each snippet is a small, self-contained unit: a name, optional tags, an optional description, and the command string. Snippets are stored locally so you don’t depend on a cloud service to recall your commands. This keeps your workflow fast and private. The tool focuses on the command surface, not the data you run through it. You can store anything that fits in a shell command line.

Key goals
- Simple to learn: a clear set of subcommands, with sensible defaults.
- Fast to use: fast search, fast execution, minimal overhead.
- Flexible: supports simple commands and more complex scripts.
- Safe: explicit prompts for dangerous operations when needed.
- Portable: works across common desktop environments with minimal setup.

Core concepts
- Snippet: a named command or a small script you want to reuse.
- Library: a local store for snippets, organized by folders and tags.
- Runner: a component that takes a snippet’s command string and executes it in your shell.
- Metadata: optional description, tags, and notes to help you remember why a snippet exists.

Quick Start
This section walks you through the fastest path from zero to a working CMDBOX setup.

Step 1: Get the installer
From the Releases page, download the Linux installer named cmdbox-linux-x64.run. The file is designed to be executed directly on most Linux systems. If you prefer Windows, you can grab cmdbox-windows-x64.exe; macOS users often have a package available as well. For Linux, the primary installation file is cmdbox-linux-x64.run. The Releases page is the source of all builds and updates.

Step 2: Make the installer executable
Open a terminal and run:
- chmod +x cmdbox-linux-x64.run

Step 3: Run the installer
In the same terminal, execute:
- ./cmdbox-linux-x64.run

Step 4: Initialize and verify
The installer creates a local library path and a default configuration. After installation, run:
- cmdbox --version
- cmdbox help
These commands confirm the tool is installed correctly and show you the available commands.

Step 5: Create your first snippet
Save a simple command as a snippet:
- cmdbox add backup-database --command "pg_dump -h localhost -U user -d mydb > /backups/mydb.sql" --description "Backup Postgres database" --tags backup,db
Then list snippets to verify:
- cmdbox list

Step 6: Run a snippet
Execute the backup:
- cmdbox run backup-database
CMDBOX will run the command in your current shell environment and show you the output, including any errors.

Step 7: Explore more
Search snippets by keyword:
- cmdbox search backup
Filter by tag:
- cmdbox list --tags db
Edit a snippet:
- cmdbox edit backup-database --command "pg_dump -h localhost -U user -d mydb --file /backups/mydb.sql"

Install and update
CMDBOX aims to keep installation simple. The Releases page hosts ready-to-run installers for major platforms. Linux users generally start with cmdbox-linux-x64.run, while Windows users grab cmdbox-windows-x64.exe. macOS users may find a package suitable for their architecture or a native binary. The Releases page is the single source of truth for installation. If you encounter a broken link or the file you expect isn’t available, check the Releases section for alternatives or newer builds.

How to manage snippets
Snippets are the core unit of CMDBOX. Each snippet is a tiny script or command set you want to reuse. There are several operations you’ll perform often.

Adding snippets
- A snippet is created with a name. You attach a command string, optional description, and tags.
- Example:
  cmdbox add deploy-app --command "kubectl apply -f k8s/deploy.yaml" --description "Deploy app to cluster" --tags deploy,devops,k8s

Listing and filtering
- List all snippets:
  cmdbox list
- Show details for a single snippet:
  cmdbox info deploy-app
- Filter by tag or text:
  cmdbox list --tags deploy
  cmdbox search kubectl

Editing snippets
- Change the command, description, or tags:
  cmdbox edit deploy-app --command "kubectl apply -f k8s/deploy.yaml" --description "Apply deployment" --tags deploy,prod

Removing snippets
- Remove a snippet when it’s no longer needed:
  cmdbox remove deploy-app

Running commands
- The run command executes the snippet’s command string in your shell. CMDBOX captures standard output and standard error for you.
- If a snippet runs long, you can interrupt it with Ctrl+C. The runner will stop the process gracefully.
- You can redirect outputs within the snippet’s command string. For example:
  cmdbox add log-rotate --command "logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf" --description "Rotate logs" --tags maintenance

Templates and presets
- Snippet templates help you start quickly. You can clone a template, then customize fields.
- Example template fields:
  - name
  - command
  - description
  - tags
  - schedule (optional, for future automation)
  - environment (optional, a small set of variables to prepend to the command)

Advanced usage
- Nested snippets: You can create a snippet that calls another snippet. While the runner executes, you can nest commands by prefixing with CMDBOX’s run command inside the snippet:
  - command: "cmdbox run setup-env && cmdbox run deploy-app"
- Environment handling: CMDBOX can pass environment variables to commands. You can define them in the snippet or the global configuration.
- Logging: You can enable verbose logging to capture details of every run. Logs go to your chosen log file or stdout.

Configuration and customization
CMDBOX is designed to be configurable without complex setup. You can tweak its behavior with a configuration file, typically placed under your home directory (for example, ~/.cmdbox/config.yaml). The configuration supports common options:

- library_path: Path to the snippet library
- default_shell: Shell used for running commands (bash, zsh, pwsh, etc.)
- editor: Command or program used to edit snippet details
- log_level: One of debug, info, warn, error
- auto_sync: Whether to sync the library with a remote store (if you enable it)
- snippet_retention: How long to keep old versions of snippets (if you enable versioning)

If you don’t have a config file, CMDBOX creates a sensible default on first run. You can customize later as you grow accustomed to the tool.

Extensions and integrations
CMDBOX is not a monolith. It supports extensions that integrate with your workflow.

- Shell integrations: Add quick alias commands to your shell for common actions.
- Version control: Store your snippet library in a git repository for version history.
- Continuous integration: Use CMDBOX to run small, repeatable commands in CI pipelines.
- SSH and remote execution: Save commands that run over SSH and reuse them from any host you manage.

Security and best practices
- Treat snippets as code: keep them clean, well-documented, and tested.
- Use least privilege: snippets that perform destructive actions should prompt for confirmation or run under a restricted user.
- Manage secrets carefully: avoid embedding passwords in snippet commands. Use environment variables or secret management tools.
- Keep the library local: unless you enable a private sync, snippets stay on your machine.

Troubleshooting
If something doesn’t work as expected, try these steps:

- Check the version: cmdbox --version
- See available commands: cmdbox help
- Verify the snippet exists: cmdbox list
- Run with verbose output if supported: cmdbox run --verbose <snippet>
- Check file permissions: ensure the installed binary is executable (chmod +x on Linux/macOS)
- Review logs: if you enabled logging, inspect the log file for errors
- Inspect the environment: some commands depend on your PATH or shell configuration

Appendix: Tips for productive usage
- Keep names short but descriptive. A good name helps you locate a snippet in seconds.
- Use tags to group related commands. Tags like deploy, test, monitor, or db help you think in contexts.
- Add descriptions. A sentence or two helps you remember why you saved the snippet.
- Script inputs: If a command needs user input, consider wrapping the input in a script or using environment variables.
- Version control: If you work with a team, keep the library in a private git repository. It helps track changes and revert when needed.
- Backups: Regular backups protect you from local hardware failures.
- Security: Avoid embedding credentials in command strings. Use environment variables and secret managers.
